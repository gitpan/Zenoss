=head1 NAME

Zenoss::Response - Handles responses from Zenoss::Router

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Zenoss;
    use Data::Dumper;
    
    # Create a Zenoss object
    my $api = Zenoss->connect(
        {
            username    => 'admin',
            password    => 'zenoss',
            url         => 'http://zenossinstance:8080',
        }
    );
    
    # Issue a request to get all devices from Zenoss
    my $response = $api->device_getDevices();
    
    # $response is now an instance of Zenoss::Response
    # now we can do things like
    print $response->json();
    print $response->http_code();
    
    # get the response in reference form
    my $reference = $response->decoded();
    print Dumper $reference;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is NOT instantiated directly.  When the Zenoss API issues a response
to a request initiated by Zenoss::Router, a Zenoss::Response instance is created.
To call methods from this module create an instance of L<Zenoss> and issue a request
to the Zenoss API.

Please review the SYNOPSIS for examples.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Attributes can be retrieved by calling $obj->attribute.

=head2 sent_tid

This attribute is set upon the creation of Zenoss::Response by Zenoss::Router.  Each
request issued to the Zenoss API is coded with a transaction ID (tid).  This can be compared
with the received_tid to ensure that the proper response was received for what was requested.

=head2 received_tid

This attribute is set by extracting the transaction ID (tid) from the response Zenoss sends.  This
can be compared with the sent_tid to ensure that the proper response was received for what was requested.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $obj->json()

Returns the response, from the Zenoss API request, in JSON format.

=head2 $obj->decoded()

Returns the result response, from the Zenoss API request, in a PERL reference.

=head2 $obj->raw_response()

Returns a textual representation of the response.

=head2 $obj->http_code()

Returns a 3 digit number that encodes the overall outcome of a HTTP response.

For example 200, for OK.

=head2 $obj->http_code_description()

Returns a short human readable single line string that explains the response code.

For example, OK.

=head2 $obj->http_status()

Returns the string "<http_code> <http_code_description>". If the http_code_description
attribute is not set then the official name of <code> (see HTTP::Status) is substituted.

=head2 $obj->is_success()

Returns true if the http response was successful.  Note this does not mean the API request
was successful or not.

See HTTP::Status for the meaning of these.

=head2 $obj->is_error()

Returns true if the http response had an error.  Note this does not mean the API request
was successful or not.

See HTTP::Status for the meaning of these.

=head2 $obj->error_as_HTML()

Returns a string containing a complete HTML document indicating what error occurred.
This method should only be called when $obj->is_error is TRUE.

=head2 $obj->header()

This is used to get header values and it is inherited from HTTP::Headers via HTTP::Message.

=head2 $obj->request_time()

Calculates the "current age" of the response as specified by RFC 2616 section 13.2.3.
The age of a response is the time since it was sent by the origin server. The returned value
is a number representing the age in seconds.

=head2 $obj->received_tid()

Returns the transaction id (tid) that was returned by Zenoss.

=head2 $obj->sent_tid()

Returns the transaction id (tid) that was sent to Zenoss
