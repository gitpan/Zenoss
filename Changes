            - Found some other bits on the documentation that required clarification.

1.06        Fri Dec 10 17:16:21 EST 2010
            - Zenoss::Response hash() was renamed to decoded().  This is because JSON can return an ARRAYREF as well
            - Zenoss::Response hash(), now called decoded(), now only returns the result JSON data structure, unless result doesnt exist
            - New attributes in Zenoss::Response received_tid and send_tid

            - Adjusted Perl version requirement to >= 5.8.3 from 5.8.9.  This is essentially the requirement of Moose as well.
            - Updated some documentation

1.08        Sun Jan 16 02:16:59 EST 2011
            - Updated Zenoss.pm to process login to Zenoss upon establishing object.  This will allow for better upfront error checking

            - Didn't include Zenoss::Router::Search in the MANIFEST, thus PAUSE didn't process the new file for distribution.  Fixed in this version.
